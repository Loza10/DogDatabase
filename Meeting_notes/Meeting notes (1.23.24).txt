1.23.24 Meeting notes:


1. Information Flow Diagram (IFD) Notes


[QUESTION]: Do we need Database to point to login on IRD? Ie if we were register a user?
Answer: Yes, we need Database to point to login




[QUESTION]: Do users have to register an account? 
Answer: 
1. Ask on canvas
2. Document says “First version of this application does not need a user interface for user management” -> SO we think there is no need for registration system yet




[QUESTION]: In dog details, we are unsure if “Expenses” would be a property of dog
Answer:
1. Review later




[ACTION NEEDED] In Adoption, we need to add a “View Adoption Applications” as we send information to the database but we also need to read from the database (“selects adopter from search results”)




[ACTION NEEDED] In Adoption Review Form, we need the arrows to be bidirectional because we are sending to the database but also need to read data from the database as well




































II. EER Diagram Notes




[ACTION NEEDED] In User, we need to check if Age needs to be included in the diagram or if that’s for later in the pseudocode/code where we check if a user’s age is >18.


[ACTION NEEDED] In User, check if we need an isAdmin feature or its own separate entity


[ACTION NEEDED] In Age, we have to double check if a puppy is less than 12 months, we need to display by months in UI. If age > 12 months then we should display years. Have an input box for years and months to track this easily


[ACTION NEEDED] Need a microchip table. 


[QUESTION] In Adopter, not sure if we need to include AdopterName based on a lecture video’s diagramming rules


[ACTION NEEDED] In Application, we need to add Application Creation Date, Decision Date


[ACTION NEEDED] In Application, we need an unique application ID of some sort. Email + Creation date could be a composite primary key as well 


[ACTION NEEDED] In Expenses, need to add date of expense, name of vendor, amount of the expense, expense category. Vendor and Date can be a key / id. 


[ACTION NEEDED] In Expenses, the type of expense should be its own table


[ACTION NEEDED] Vendors might be another table as well


[ACTION NEEDED] In Expense category will be its own category
